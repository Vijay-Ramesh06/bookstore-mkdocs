# Introduction

The BookStore API is a RESTful web service designed to power online bookstore applications. It provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing every aspect of a bookstore, from product listings to customer orders and inventory management.

## Design Principles

The BookStore API follows REST conventions and is designed to be predictable, consistent, and easy to use.

### RESTful Design

All resources are represented as nouns and accessed via standard HTTP methods:

| Method | Usage |
|---|---|
| `GET` | Retrieve a resource or list of resources |
| `POST` | Create a new resource |
| `PUT` | Replace an existing resource completely |
| `PATCH` | Partially update an existing resource |
| `DELETE` | Remove a resource |

### Consistent Response Structure

Every API response follows the same envelope format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "req-abc123",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

For list responses, a `pagination` object is included:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [ ... ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 250,
    "page": 1,
    "perPage": 20,
    "totalPages": 13
  }
}
```

### Predictable Errors

Error responses always include a code, message, and details to help you debug quickly. See the [Error Reference](../basics/errors.md) for the full list.

## Who Is This API For?

The BookStore API is designed for:

- **Frontend developers** building web or mobile bookstore applications
- **Backend developers** integrating bookstore data into larger systems
- **DevOps engineers** automating inventory and order management workflows
- **Data analysts** extracting sales and inventory data

## API Stability

The BookStore API follows semantic versioning. The current version is `v1`. Breaking changes are introduced only in new major versions. Non-breaking additions such as new fields or endpoints may be added at any time within the same version.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started is the [Quickstart Guide](../basics/quickstart.md). It walks through authentication, making your first request, and common workflows in under five minutes.
