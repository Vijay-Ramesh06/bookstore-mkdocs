### New Features

- **Review Filtering**: The `GET /v1/books/{bookId}/reviews` endpoint now supports filtering by `rating` and `verified` query parameters.
- **Inventory Alerts Webhook**: New webhook event `inventory.low` fires when a book's stock falls below its `reorderLevel`.
- **Bulk Book Update**: New endpoint `PATCH /v1/books/bulk` allows updating up to 50 books in a single request.
- **Author Books Endpoint**: New endpoint `GET /v1/authors/{authorId}/books` returns all books by a specific author with pagination.

### Bug Fixes
