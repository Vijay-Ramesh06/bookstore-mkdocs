# Best Practices

This guide covers recommended patterns for building reliable, secure, and efficient integrations with the BookStore API.

## Authentication

- Store your API key in environment variables, not in source code or config files
- Use separate API keys for development, staging, and production
- Use read-only keys whenever write access is not needed
- Set expiry dates on all API keys and rotate them regularly
- Revoke keys immediately when a team member leaves

## Error Handling

- Always check HTTP status codes — never assume a request succeeded
- Log the `requestId` from error responses to help with debugging and support
- Implement exponential backoff for transient errors (500, 503)
- Show user-friendly error messages for 4xx errors rather than raw API responses
- Handle `409 Conflict` gracefully by checking for duplicates before creating resources

## Performance

- Use pagination with the maximum `perPage` value (100) to reduce API calls when fetching large datasets
- Cache static data such as category lists, which change infrequently. A 1-hour cache is appropriate.
- Use the `fields` query parameter where supported to request only the fields you need
- Use webhooks for real-time updates rather than polling the API repeatedly
- Batch operations where possible using bulk endpoints

## Reliability

- Use idempotency keys for POST requests that create orders to prevent duplicate submissions
- Implement retry logic with backoff for network failures
- Monitor the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header and slow down requests as you approach the limit
- Set appropriate request timeouts in your HTTP client (recommended: 10–30 seconds)

## Security

- Never expose your API key in client-side code (browser JavaScript, mobile apps)
- Use a backend proxy to make API calls from client applications
- Always verify webhook signatures before processing events
- Validate and sanitize data received from the API before storing or displaying it
- Use HTTPS for all API communication — never HTTP

## Testing

- Maintain a separate test environment with its own API key and staging data
- Write tests that cover both success and error cases
- Mock API calls in unit tests and use the real staging API only for integration tests
- Clean up test data after each test run to avoid interference between tests

## Versioning

- Always specify the API version in your base URL (`/v1/`)
- Monitor the API changelog for deprecation notices
- Test against new API versions in staging before upgrading in production
- Subscribe to the developer newsletter for advance notice of breaking changes
